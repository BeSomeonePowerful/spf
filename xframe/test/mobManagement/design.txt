//only one task
//many class
//depending on the type of deployment,we init different task

//abstract task ,we overload these method
//onInit(), preTaskStart(),clone(),procMsg(),onTimeOut()


//ua,we make mobile management one task either in microSat or in backboneSat
//cme-u (what kind of message can be received,what interface it exposes to the
//external world)


//how do cme-u handle or proc a msg?
//when a msg is received,certain ds need to set up and mMaintain
//then after processing the msg,a return msg is needed
//when will uareg module be called,how to call it
//uareg should be called on initialization
//how to do with cache and subList,do we need to add a timestamp
//messages received by cme-u if the receiver(user) can't be found immediately,cache it
//for a moment
//如何判断报文类业务和对话类业务。
//用户地址查询和用户地址订阅的发起流程。如何发起？
//rme和cme之间的交互??rsc是如何分发消息的？如何设置rsc对消息的分发？
//rid or callid? In which way is callid is maintained.
//do we still need a timer in rsc??or should apptask main a timer?(currently assuming
//rsc maintain a timer)
//what does consumer and producer mean? using a simple case.

//how to maintain the order of message?as in the case of user-register...自动机可以是一个选项。
//一个callid对应一个statemachine

//msg type,sender: ,receiver:

//what to do with ua and cme-h?
//should ua query with nme before sending a msg or it just sending a msg to
//cme-h ? since the connection between microsat and mainsat is weak compared
//to the connection between mainsat. However,.


//messages are distributed according to ruri
//build a quick demo as fast as possible
//rsc消息中host域的作用

//do we really need statemachine in every process?
//currently it's the better solution I can come up with.


//how do we test each module independently?
//using mock task,sending and receiving mock message.

//a number of modules could be in the same machine.

//complete the addr resolve code and test

//how do we validate the structe of our program??
//if we use network,we use rscpsa,is rscpsa capable of sending msg
//between different threads on the same machine?


//in the test,we build a abstracttask to simulate rscpsa
//一个流程一个流程地测试，一个功能一个功能地测试
//需要维护seqid..
//phyAddr 是什么，与logAddr的区别

//in the test of program.
//we set the producer as the ipport of from end of msg,consumer as the to end
